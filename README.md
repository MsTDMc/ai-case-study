# How AI is Shaping the Future of Medicine

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company Generate Biomedicines

* When was the company incorporated? Based in Somerville, Massachussetts, Generate Biomedicines was incorporated in 2018.

* Who are the founders of the company? Generate Biomedicines has three co-founders: Molly Gibson, Gevorg Grigoryan, and Geoffrey von Maltzahn.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The possibility for AI to sequence and model protein-based drugs is the natural evolution from AI prediction and image generating technologies such as DALL-E and ChatGPT. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? deep learning 
Generate Biomedicines is privately funded from investors and venture capitalists. In the last three years Generate Biometrics has received $643million with $273million of which being secured in  

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Historically, creating new drugs and medicinal therapies took a great deal of time and money to test hundreds of thousands of protein sequences one at at time just to find only a single solution which may or may not be the most efficient. AI image generating sequence proteins can sequence proteins to model protein-based drugs in a matter months as opposed to years or even decades.  

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
Generate Biomedicines target for these the production of their protein-based drugs encompass medical patients of all kinds from treating oncology patients to developing treatment for infectious diseases, immunotherapy and treatment for rare diseases. The market for protein based therapies in the U.S. alone is 1.5 billion and estimated to grow at least 30.1% over the next 10 years.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Generate Biomedicines offers the opportunity to produce protein-based medicine at an unprecedented rate. With an astounding 97% failure rate of traditional drugs, AI has made it possible to generate  protein-based medicine in a fraction of the time as traditional methods. AI generated protein-medicine is not as toxic as traditional medicines, it is more specified to target it's intended purpose, and are less likely to couse side effects. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Generate Biomedicines utilizes an Chroma, an AI technology that sequences proteins through AI imaging. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Protein drug development 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
It is hard to point out a ten year trend when it comes to drug development because new drug development takes an average of 10-15 years. This makes it difficult to develop drugs for rare or uncommon diseases creating a huge opportuninty While the use of diffusion models for protein generation is not new but the use of AI imaging to cut the sequencing time into a fraction of what it traditionally takes is groundbreaking technology.

* What are the other major companies in this field? The top companies in the development of protein-based medicine are: ACMED, BenchSci, Atomwise, and C4 Therapeutics. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? Success metrics in pharmaceuticals is complicated and it depends on who you ask, patients? Doctors? Investors? I fall into the category of patient so the success metric of patients is gauged by its efficiency contrasted with minimal side effects. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) I would advise Generate Biomedicines to generate vaccines. With so many factors contributing, infectious diseases are on the rise. A whopping 75% of infectious diseases are estimated to be zoonotic. The growth of urban spaces encroaching evermore, the barrier between wild life and modern civilization is barely existent. Global warming combined with the 40% increase in meat consumption since the 1960's compounded with the degradation of wild-life habitats it should come at no surprise that infectious diseases are on the rise. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Sequencing protein-based vaccines would put Generate Biomedicines at the forefront of biomedicine. It is estimated that 81% of the United States population has received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. Around 80%-90% of all babies in the U.S. receive multiple rounds of vaccines before the age of 2. The whole world was in awe and skepticism when the Covid vaccine came out so quickly without realizing that it's development was long underway decades before the worldwide pandemic. By sequencing protein-based vaccines for the infectious diseases most likely to 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? The introduction of AI Imaging is appropriate for sequencing protein-based vaccines by completing the process at a rate that has never been seen before. AI Imaging technology is already being used to sequence vaccines and immunotherapies. While there are
