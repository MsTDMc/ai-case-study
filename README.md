# How AI is Shaping the Future of Medicine

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company Generate Biomedicines

* When was the company incorporated? Based in Somerville, Massachussetts, Generate Biomedicines was incorporated in 2018.

* Who are the founders of the company? Generate Biomedicines has three co-founders: Molly Gibson, Gevorg Grigoryan, and Geoffrey von Maltzahn.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The possibility for AI to sequence and model protein-based drugs is the natural evolution from AI prediction and image generating technologies such as DALL-E and ChatGPT. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? deep learning 
Generate Biomedicines is privately funded from investors and venture capitalists. In the last three years Generate Biometrics has received $643million with $273million of which was secured in 2023.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Historically, creating new drugs and medicinal therapies took a great deal of time and money to test hundreds of thousands of protein sequences one at at time just to find only a single solution which may or may not be the most efficient. AI image generating sequence proteins can sequence proteins to model protein-based drugs in a matter months as opposed to the years and even decades that it took before the application of AI in protein sequencing.  

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
Generate Biomedicines target for these the production of their protein-based drugs encompass medical patients of all kinds from treating oncology patients to developing treatment for infectious diseases, immunotherapy and treatment for rare diseases. The market for protein based therapies in the U.S. alone is 1.5 billion and estimated to grow at least 30.1% over the next 10 years.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Generate Biomedicines offers the opportunity to produce protein-based medicine at an unprecedented rate. With an astounding 97% failure rate of traditional drugs, AI has made it possible to generate  protein-based medicine in a fraction of the time as traditional methods. AI generated protein-medicine is not as toxic as traditional medicines, it is more specified to target it's intended purpose, and are less likely to cause side effects. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Generate Biomedicines utilizes Chroma, an AI technology that sequences proteins through AI 3-D imaging. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? AI is in the medical field of drug development. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
It is hard to point out a ten year trend when it comes to drug development because new drug development takes an average of 10-15 years. Trends in drug development in the last 10 years has seen innovation with immunotherapy, cell therapy, and gene therapy to create precision based medicine. While the use of diffusion models for protein sequencing and generation is not new the use of AI imaging technology is. AI imaging technology cuts the sequencing time into a fraction of what it traditionally takes.

* What are the other major companies in this field? The top companies in the development of protein-based medicine are: Finch Therapeutics, SynbiCITE, and MicroBio Engineering.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? Success metrics in drug development is complicated as the production of new drugs can take decades to 10 years at best and new drug development success rates rest around 10%. The bar isn't set too high because the development of new drugs is a long, expensive process. Considering that Generate Biomedicines is a new company that started in 2018 they have already proven successful by their ability to create new drugs across a broad spectrum of medical demands and in a fraction of the time while cutting the cost of traditional drug development. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Considering that it is a very young company, they have raised almost double the funds of their closest competitors while still managing to stay privately funded. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) I would advise Generate Biomedicines to generate vaccines. With so many factors contributing, infectious diseases are on the rise. A whopping 75% of infectious diseases are estimated to be zoonotic. The growth of urban spaces encroaching evermore, the barrier between wild life and modern civilization is barely existent. Global warming combined with the 40% increase in meat consumption since the 1960's compounded with the degradation of wild-life habitats it should come at no surprise that infectious diseases are on the rise and with that is the demand for vaccines. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Sequencing protein-based vaccines would put Generate Biomedicines at the forefront of biomedicine. It is estimated that 81% of the United States population has received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. Around 80%-90% of all babies in the U.S. receive multiple rounds of vaccines before the age of 2. Developing protein-based vaccines would establish Generate Biomedicines as a serious competitor in drug development. With the decline in antibiotic effectiveness, and the trend towards preventative healthcare, medicine is turing to vaccines more and more. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Generate Biomedicines already has the technologies like Chroma that are necessary to sequence protein-based vaccines. Since the pandemic exacerbated the inequality of vaccine accessibility, open source data to support vaccine development is on the rise making it more accessible and affordable companies invested in developing vaccines. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? The introduction of AI Imaging is appropriate for sequencing protein-based vaccines by sequencing proteins. AI Imaging technology, like Chroma, is already being used to develop vaccines as well as other immunotherapies. AI imaging technology like Chroma is central to developing vaccines as the necessity for vaccines is immediate. Vaccines for infectious diseases are always going to be an immediate problem that demands an immediate solution. AI imaging technology, like Chroma, is the the most advanced technology currently available to model new vaccines in a timely manner.
